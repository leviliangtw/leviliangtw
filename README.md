### Hi there, I am Jih-Wei Liang ðŸ‘‹
I am a MSc. Informatics student at Technische UniversitÃ¤t MÃ¼nchen currently. 
I worked previously as a software engineer in Republic of China Air Force (Taiwan) for 4 years, dealing with the fields of `Software Engineering` and `Site Reliability Engineering`. 
I also have great interests in `cybersecurity` and `virtualization techniques`. 

### About my learning now...
Apart from the experience in `Software Engineering`, I am developing more deeper knowledge domain in `Computer Architecture`, `Distribution Systems` and `Virtualization Techniques`. 
I would like to work on areas in `System Programming` as my next step.
